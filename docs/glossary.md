# Details about Technical Terms

## PPP (Public–Private Partnership)

PPP is an infrastructure procurement and financing model where a government partners with a private entity to design, build, finance, operate, or maintain public assets (roads, airports, ports, bridges).

Why is it needed?
Governments need infrastructure but lack money, expertise, or execution speed.

Suppose that government has 100 crore alloted as budget for roads and lets say each road costs around 50 crore to build, so government can build only 2 roads. But lets say the requiremnet is to build 10 roads, then how will the government go about it? This is where PPP comes in, where government partners with a private entity which will bring in expertise and execution speed and complete the project. The finance can be collected as toll.

**Structure**

- Public sector → sets standards and regulates
- Private sector → invests and executes
- Risk → shared between both parties

## Infrastructure Project Models

All infrastructure models differ based on three axes:

- Who finances?
- Who collects revenue?
- Who bears risk?

Different combinations produce different models.

### BOT – Annuity

- Private builds project; government pays fixed annuities.
- Private bears construction risk; government bears traffic risk.
- **Used when:** demand is uncertain.

### BOT – Toll

- Private finances, builds, and collects toll revenue.
- Private bears traffic and revenue risk.
- **Used when:** traffic demand is predictable.

### BOOT

- Private owns, operates, and later transfers asset.
- Differs from BOT because ownership stays with private partner during concession.

### DBFOT

- Private partner designs, builds, finances, operates, then transfers.
- Essentially BOT with explicit design + financing responsibility.

### HAM (Hybrid Annuity Model)

- Govt pays ~40% construction cost
- Private funds ~60%
- Govt pays annuity during operation
- Risk is shared.

### EPC (Not PPP) (Engineering, Procurement, and Construction)

- Contractor only builds project for fixed cost.
- Government funds, owns, and operates.
- Used for faster execution and full public control.
